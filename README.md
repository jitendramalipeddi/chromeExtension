chrome extension using Youtube data API
<br>
To learn Java script in an interactive way I satarted this.<br>
I always wanted to create plugins and make use of them so started with this simple one that uses Youtube API and just returns the duration of a opened video in seconds.<br>
Started in JS from 0. But with the help of this learning bits and bites of it.<br>
